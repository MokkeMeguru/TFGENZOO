* What's this repository?
  This is a repository for some researcher to build some Generative models using Tensorflow 2.0.

  I NEED YOUR HELP(please let me know about formula, implementation and anything you worried)
* Zen of this repository
#+begin_example
We don't want to need flexible architectures.
We need strict definitions for shapes, parameters, and formulas.
We should Implement correct codes with well-documented(tested).
#+end_example

* How to run?
  1. clone this repository (If you want to do it, I will push this repository to PYPI)
  2. build this repository ~docker-compose build~
  3. run the environment ~sh run_script.sh~
  4. connect it via VSCode or Emacs or vi or anything.

* Roadmap
    - [ ] Flow-based Model Architecture (RealNVP, Glow)
    - [ ] i-ResNet Model Architecture (i-ResNet, i-RevNet)
    - [ ] GANs Model Architecture (GANs)
